# This constraint sets the target clock period for the chip in
# nanoseconds. Note that the first parameter is the name of the clock
# signal in your verlog design. If you called it something different than
# clk you will need to change this. You should set this constraint
# carefully. If the period is unrealistically small then the tools will
# spend forever trying to meet timing and ultimately fail. If the period
# is too large the tools will have no trouble but you will get a very
# conservative implementation.

# This script creates different timing constraints under different memory mode
# configurations.  The general flow is to define a scenario, read in a script
# containing generalized constraints for the designs, then provide overriding
# constraints in different operational modes.

# This constraint sets the input drive strength of the input pins of
# your design. We specifiy a specific standard cell which models what
# would be driving the inputs. This should usually be a small inverter
# which is reasonable if another block of on-chip logic is driving
# your inputs.
