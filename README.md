This repository contains the files for a simple CGRA module: the connect box. In this repo you will find:
* A python functional model for the connect box
* The original Genesis2 source for the connect box, along with scripts to generate Verilog from the Genesis2 file
* An implementation of the connect box in Magma
* Test harnesses to regress the Magma implementation against the original Genesis2 implementation (as well as against the functional model).
